## Hey there!

ü¶Ñ I'm Jia Qi, a **final year Computer Science undergraduate** at Nanyang Technological University with a strong passion for building meaningful technology solutions. My expertise lies in **full-stack development**, **data analytics** and **artificial intelligence**, areas where I thrive on solving complex problems and creating user-centered applications. 

üêæ My journey began with a **Diploma in AI and Analytics**, where I developed a fascination for how computing and AI can transform industries and improve lives. Over the years, I have worked on projects that include web development, machine learning models, and data visualization, honing both my technical and problem-solving skills. 

ü§ñ Beyond academics, I am actively engaged in contributing to external projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring innovative ideas to life through hackathons.
